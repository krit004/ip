## Dynamic Bobo Personality

Bobo isn't just an ordinary task tracker—Bobo has a **dynamic personality** that evolves based on the number of items stored in your task list!

As your task list grows, Bobo transforms across 5 distinct size categories:

- **Stage 1 (0–4 tasks)**: Extremely tiny, nervous, squeaky Bobo.
  - *Example Greeting*: `*squeak!* Eep! Hi there... I-I'm tiny Bobo... please don't step on me!`
- **Stage 2 (5–8 tasks)**: Small but more confident Bobo.
  - *Example Greeting*: `Hello hello! Bobo is growing a tiny bit bigger and feeling steady!`
- **Stage 3 (9–12 tasks)**: Average-sized, energetic Bobo.
  - *Example Greeting*: `Hey there! Bobo here, bursting with energy and ready to crush to-dos!`
- **Stage 4 (13–16 tasks)**: Large, booming, confident Bobo.
  - *Example Greeting*: `**GREETINGS MORTAL!** BOBO HAS GROWN LARGE AND FULL OF POWER!`
- **Stage 5 (17+ tasks)**: Giant Titan Bobo with dramatic, powerful wording.
  - *Example Greeting*: `**BEHOLD THE MIGHTY TITAN BOBO! SHAKER OF WORLDS, COMMANDER OF TASKS!**`

Bobo's personality recalculates dynamically whenever you add, delete, or load tasks on startup!
